## The Architecture
Please view the following: [System Architecture](https://github.com/trungvu08/GF2ER/blob/main/CFC%20GFEXR_System%20Architecture.pdf).

## Getting Started
In this section, you’ll be installing the prerequisites needed before you can bootstrap your project, such as Python 3.

### Prerequisites:

 ·         **Installing Python 3**
 
There is a big chance that you already have Python 3 installed on your system. If you don’t, you can simply head to the official website https://www.python.org/downloads/  and download the binaries for your operating system.

Depending on your system, you may also be able to install Python 3 or upgrade it to the latest version if it’s already installed by using the official package manager.

If you have a problem installing Python 3 or want more information, you can check the Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide https://realpython.com/installing-python/, which provides different ways to install Python 3 on your system.

Finally, you can check if you have Python 3 installed by running the following command:$ python3 --version

·         **Installing Django**

Django is the most popular Python framework for building web apps. It’s free, open source and written in python. Django offers a big collection of modules which you can use in your own projects. It makes it easy for developers to quickly build prototypes by providing a plethora of built-in APIs and sub-frameworks such as GeoDjango.

The Django package is available from the Python Package Index (PyPI)

https://pypi.org/ so, you can simply use pip to install it by running the following command in your terminal:

$ pip install django

Or         $ pip install django  --upgrade (if already installed)

**To run the website:**
Download the project (located in master branch)

In your terminal, CD and then run:

**Python manage.py runserver**
	
The application will be hosted at **localhost:8000**
